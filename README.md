# PodiumPredict

PodiumPredict is a project intended to predict the results of upcoming powerlifting meets based off of data pulled from OpenPowerlifting (https://www.openpowerlifting.org) and Liftingcast (https://liftingcast.com).

Lifters at upcoming meets are searched via OpenPowerlifting and will have their highest SBD total compared against one another, segregated by their weight class and age division. The aim of this project is to display a coherent diagram of each lifter's placement at a meet.
